# Astract

The project focuses on the design and implementation of a Quantum Random Bit Generator (QRBG) controlled by a single-board controller that is interfaced in bare-metal mode through Forth, a lightweight, stack-based, intermediate-level language that provides an efficient management for both computational and communication tasks.
