 The current project directory contains all of the files and documentation for the Quantum Random Bit Generation Embedded Systems project.

 The Forth code of this repo is divided in modules, each corresponding to a different section of the overall implementation. Each module has inside it two files, one with comments (e.g., laser.f) and one without (laser_raw.f), to aid dumping its content onto a terminal interface for testing.

 In addition, a separate module named 'merged' contains the commented and uncommented version of all of the linked modules. This way, the project can be consulted by either accessing individual sections, or by reading the entire merged.f file in one go.
